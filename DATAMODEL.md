# Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Events and Attributes used for media monitoring in New Relic.

# Glossary

This section defines the key terms used in the context of New Relic Media monitoring:

## Event Types

- **ConnectedDeviceSystem**: Events related to system tracking.
- **videoAction**: Events triggered by general video interactions, such as starting, pausing, or seeking.
- **videoAdAction**: Events related to ad playback, such as starting, completing, or skipping an ad.
- **videoErrorAction**: Events triggered by errors encountered during video or ad playback.
- **videoCustomAction**: Custom events defined to capture specific actions or interactions beyond default event types.

## Attribute

An Attribute is a piece of data associated with an event. Attributes provide additional context or details about the event, such as the video’s title, duration, or playback position.

- Most attributes are included with every event.
- Some attributes are specific to certain event types, such as ad-related data sent with ad events.
