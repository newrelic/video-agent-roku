# New Relic Roku Agent

The New Relic Roku Agent tracks the behavior of a Roku App. It contains two parts, one to monitor general system level events and one to monitor video related events, for apps that use a video player.

Internally, it uses the Event API to send events using the REST interface. It sends five types of events: 
- ConnectedDeviceSystem for system events
- VideoAction for video events. 
- VideoErrorAction for errors.
- VideoAdAction for ads.
- VideoCustomAction for custom actions.
After the agent has sent some data it will be accessible in NR One Dashboards with a simple NRQL request like:

```
SELECT * FROM ConnectedDeviceSystem, VideoAction, VideoErrorAction, VideoAdAction, VideoCustomAction
```
Will result in something like the following:

<a name="requirements"></a>

### Requirements

To initialize the agent you need an [ACCOUNT ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/) and a [LICENSE KEY](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key). 

<a name="installation"></a>

### Installation

1. Download the [Roku Video Agent](https://github.com/newrelic/video-agent-roku/releases/latest) and unzip it. Inside the package you will find the following file structure:

```
components/NewRelicAgent/
	NRAgent.brs
	NRAgent.xml
	NRTask.brs
	NRTask.xml
source/
	NewRelicAgent.brs
```

2. Open your Roku app project’s directory and copy the “NewRelicAgent” folder to “components” and "NewRelicAgent.brs" file to “source”.

<a name="usage"></a>

### Usage

To enable automatic event capture perform the following steps which are detailed below.

1. Call `NewRelic` from Main subroutine and store the returned object.
2. Right after that, call `nrAppStarted` (optional but recommended).
3. Call `NewRelicSystemStart` and `NewRelicVideoStart` to start capturing events for system and video (both optional).
4. Inside the main wait loop, call `nrProcessMessage` (only mandatory to capture system events, otherwise not necessary).

#### Example

> Note: For a more complete example, please refer to the sample app included in the present repository. Specifically files Main.brs and files inside components directory.

*Main.brs*

```brightscript
sub Main(aa as Object)
	screen = CreateObject("roSGScreen")
	m.port = CreateObject("roMessagePort")
	screen.setMessagePort(m.port)

	'Create the main scene that contains a video player
	scene = screen.CreateScene("VideoScene")
	screen.show()
	    
	'Init New Relic Agent
	m.nr = NewRelic(“ACCOUNT ID“, “API KEY“)
	    
	'Send APP_STARTED event
	nrAppStarted(m.nr, aa)
	    
	'Pass NewRelicAgent object to the main scene
	scene.setField("nr", m.nr)
	    
	'Activate system tracking
	m.syslog = NewRelicSystemStart(m.port)
    
	while (true)
		msg = wait(0, m.port)
		if nrProcessMessage(m.nr, msg) = false
			'It is not a system message captured by New Relic Agent
			if type(msg) = "roPosterScreenEvent"
				if msg.isScreenClosed()
					exit while
				end if
			end if
		end if
	end while
end sub
```

*VideoScene.xml*

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<component name="VideoScene" extends="Scene"> 
	<interface>
		<!-- Field used to pass the NewRelicAgent object to the scene -->
		<field id="nr" type="node" onChange="nrRefUpdated" />
	</interface>
		
	<children>
		<Video
			id="myVideo"
			translation="[0,0]"

	<script type="text/brightscript" uri="pkg:/source/NewRelicAgent.brs"/>
	
	<script type="text/brightscript" uri="pkg:/components/VideoScene.brs"/>
</component>
```

*VideoScene.brs*

```brightscript
sub init()
    m.top.setFocus(true)
    setupVideoPlayer()
end sub

function nrRefUpdated()
    m.nr = m.top.nr
    
    'Activate video tracking
    NewRelicVideoStart(m.nr, m.video)
end function

function setupVideoPlayer()
    videoUrl = "http://..."
    videoContent = createObject("RoSGNode", "ContentNode")
    videoContent.url = videoUrl
    videoContent.title = "Any Video"
    m.video = m.top.findNode("myVideo")
    m.video.content = videoContent
    m.video.control = "play"
end function
```

<a name="data-model"></a>
### Data Model
To understand which actions and attributes are captured and emitted by the Dash Player under different event types, see [DataModel.md](./DATAMODEL.md).

<a name="ad-track"></a>
### Ad Tracking

The Roku Video Agent also provides Ad events monitoring. Currently we support two different Ad APIs: [Roku Advertising Framework (RAF)](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/developer-program/advertising/roku-advertising-framework.md) and [Google IMA](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/roku).

#### Installation

For RAF there is no additional steps required, because the tracker is integrated inside the NRAgent, but for IMA, the following files must be included in the project:

```
components/NewRelicAgent/trackers
	IMATracker.brs
	IMATracker.xml
source/
	IMATrackerInterface.brs
```

#### RAF Usage

First we have to pass the NRAgent object (created with the call to `NewRelic(accountId, apiKey)`) to the Ads Task. This can be achieved using a field. Once done, inside the Ads Task we must do:

```brightscript
adIface = Roku_Ads()

' Ad Iface setup code...

logFunc = Function(obj = Invalid as Dynamic, evtType = invalid as Dynamic, ctx = invalid as Dynamic)
    'Call RAF tracker, passing the event and context
    nrTrackRAF(obj, evtType, ctx)
End Function

' m.top.nr is the reference to the field where we have the NRAgent object
adIface.setTrackingCallback(logFunc, m.top.nr)
```

For a complete usage example, checkout files `VideoScene.brs` (function `setupVideoWithAds()`) and `AdsTask.brs` in the present repo.

#### IMA Usage

First we have to create the IMA Tracker object:

```brightscript
tracker = IMATracker(m.nr)
```

Where `m.nr` is the NRAgent object.

Then we need to pass the tracker object to the IMA SDK Task, using a field. And include the script `IMATrackerInterface.brs` in the task XML.

Once done, inside the task we must do:

```brightscript
m.player.adBreakStarted = Function(adBreakInfo as Object)
	'Ad break start code...
	    
	'Send AD_BREAK_START
	nrSendIMAAdBreakStart(m.top.tracker, adBreakInfo)
End Function
m.player.adBreakEnded = Function(adBreakInfo as Object)
	'Ad break end code...
    
    'Send AD_BREAK_END
    nrSendIMAAdBreakEnd(m.top.tracker, adBreakInfo)
End Function

'...

m.streamManager.addEventListener(m.sdk.AdEvent.START, startCallback)
m.streamManager.addEventListener(m.sdk.AdEvent.FIRST_QUARTILE, firstQuartileCallback)
m.streamManager.addEventListener(m.sdk.AdEvent.MIDPOINT, midpointCallback)
m.streamManager.addEventListener(m.sdk.AdEvent.THIRD_QUARTILE, thirdQuartileCallback)
m.streamManager.addEventListener(m.sdk.AdEvent.COMPLETE, completeCallback)

Function startCallback(ad as Object) as Void
	'Send AD_START
	nrSendIMAAdStart(m.top.tracker, ad)
End Function

Function firstQuartileCallback(ad as Object) as Void
	'Send AD_QUARTILE (first)
	nrSendIMAAdFirstQuartile(m.top.tracker, ad)
End Function

Function midpointCallback(ad as Object) as Void
	'Send AD_QUARTILE (midpoint)
	nrSendIMAAdMidpoint(m.top.tracker, ad)
End Function

Function thirdQuartileCallback(ad as Object) as Void
	'Send AD_QUARTILE (third)
	nrSendIMAAdThirdQuartile(m.top.tracker, ad)
End Function

Function completeCallback(ad as Object) as Void
	'Send AD_END
	nrSendIMAAdEnd(m.top.tracker, ad)
End Function
```

Where `m.top.tracker` is the tracker object passed to the task.

For a complete usage example, checkout files `VideoScene.brs` (function `setupVideoWithIMA()`) and `imasdk.brs` in the present repo.

### Testing

To run the unit tests, first copy the file `UnitTestFramework.brs` from [unit-testing-framework](https://github.com/rokudev/unit-testing-framework) to `source/testFramework/`. Then install the demo channel provided in the present repo and from a terminal run:

```bash
./test.sh ROKU_IP
```

Where `ROKU_IP` is the address of the Roku device where the channel is installed. Connect to the debug terminal (port 8085) to see test results. You can also provide the dev password as a second argument if you want to compile and deploy before running tests.

### Debugging
Network proxying is supported using URL re-write (see [App Level Proxying](https://rokulikeahurricane.io/proxying_network_requests)). To send all network requests via a proxy call `nrUpdateConfig()` function with the `proxyUrl` parameter object property. Be sure to specify the same URL delimiter as your proxy re-write rule.
